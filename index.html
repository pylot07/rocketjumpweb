                <h2>What is a "rocket jump?"</h2>
                <p>
                    A rocket jump is any jump assisted by the explosive knockback of the Soldier's own rockets.
                    A player can propel himself to great heights and distances, usually at the cost of some health.
                    This technique is often used to reach unusual locations on the map, cover ground quickly, bypass
                    barriers, and surprise foes.
                    To assist with rocket jumps, the Soldier has a <span class="blue">40% damage resistance</span>
                    against
                    any rocket he fires that hurts him while he is in the air.
                    This resistance will take effect even if an enemy was hit with the same rocket used to rocket jump,
                    unlike the <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Gunboats">Gunboats</a>.
                    Critical hits do not deal extra self-damage or extra knockback to the Soldier, so they will not
                    propel
                    him further.
                    Any rocket jumping Soldier will display burning, smoky boots until he lands, similar to the Demoman.

                <h2>Standard Rocket Jump</h2>
                <p>
                    To execute a rocket jump, simultaneously jump and fire a rocket at the ground below. The angle of
                    the
                    shot and distance from the
                    explosion will determine the velocity and height of the jump. Crouch-jumping before firing the
                    rocket
                    will launch the player
                    significantly farther. The sooner the explosion is made after jumping, the farther and faster the
                    Soldier will fly.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Crouch-jumping</h2>
                <p>
                    At any point during a jump, the player can crouch by pressing the pre-assigned button. This will
                    cause
                    the classes to bring their
                    legs up in world view and move an additional Hammer unit up, as well as reduce their height by 27
                    Hammer
                    units from the bottom of
                    their hitbox. This allows them to reach higher surfaces or shrink their hitboxes to dodge enemy
                    fire. By
                    default, a player may only
                    crouch and uncrouch twice while in the air to prevent several exploits.
                    Crouch-jumping is also used to boost the effect of explosive knockback. By design, any jump
                    involving an
                    explosive will go farther
                    with a crouch-jump than a regular jump.

                <h2>Air Strafing</h2>
                <p>
                    Air strafing allows players to curve in mid-air to change their trajectory. While airborne, it can
                    be
                    performed by simultaneously strafing
                    and turning smoothly in the same direction. Attempting to move forward with the movement keys (such
                    as
                    holding W) during the maneuver will
                    prevent the player from strafing, while attempting to move backward will also result in a decrease
                    of
                    speed.

                <h2>Pogo</h2>
                <p>
                    Pogo jumps are secondary rocket jumps made against the ground to increase your airtime. The explosion 
                    should keep you airborne and potentially increase forward momentum. Skipping is the high speed variant. 
                    You must predict your location and sometimes aim ahead to ensure that the rocket lands directly beneath you, 
                    or you might fail and touch the ground. You must always be crouching during these jumps, as failure to do 
                    so makes your jumps far less powerful.

                <h2>Wall Jumps</h2>
                <p>
                    Wall jumps can be made while in the air and against a wall. Continue to hold crouch and fire down below 
                    yourself on the wall. The explosion will produce a second jump. Rocket jumps and wall jumps can be chained 
                    together to gain great distance or height.

                <h2>Water Jumps</h2>
                <p>
                    Water jumping is using the water physics of the Source engine to gain extra momentum. Players that are
                    in the process of surfacing in deep water receive a minor boost upwards; rocket jumping during this time
                    (likely against a wall) will augment this force into a very strong jump. cp_well is the most likely place 
                    to find this kind of jump. Ctapping in shallow water will result in an incredibly strong jump.

                <h2>Speedshot</h2>
                <p>
                    Speedshots are done when you have a large amount of horizontal speed, you are close to the ground, and
                    your rocket explodes 90 degrees below you. The timing is strict, but it allows for you to gain large
                    amounts of speed and is necessary for certain rollouts and jump maps.

                <h2>Speed Pogo</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you got the standard pogo down, it is time to learn the speedpogo. A speedpogo, hence the name,
                    is a pogo with speed.
                    This can be started in 3 ways: fall from a platform to pogo, spacebar jump up into pogo or by a low
                    wall rocketjump.
                    Speedpogo barely differs from a standard pogo. The only difference is that the faster you go, the
                    more you have to aim ahead of you on the ground.
                    Just as with walljumping, there also is a limit of how fast you can go until the rockets cannot
                    catch up with you anymore, so don't be too much of
                    a speed maniac and tap S when you think you're going a little too fast. You either start from a
                    normal pogo or via a low wall rocketjump.
                    From a normal pogo, occasionally fire a bit more behind you until speed builds up. Always focus on
                    control and balance.
                    Once speed is building up, gradually shoot more and more ahead of you so your rockets catch up with
                    you and tap S when necessary.

                <h2>Sync Jumps</h2>
                <p>
                    Double rocket jumps, also known as sync jumps, require two rockets to detonate as you jump, and can
                    only be performed on a few maps. If you fire a rocket downwards and fall after it, you will eventually
                    fall faster than your own shot. After landing, you then rocket jump as your first rocket strikes the 
                    ground. The combined explosions sends you much farther and higher than is otherwise possible. 
                    Looking up at the rocket to see when it will reach you makes timing the jump easier.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Triple rocket jumps are a harder variant of the jump described above. They use three rockets instead 
                    of two and can be performed by either shooting two rockets in quick succession after dropping down, 
                    or by shooting a second rocket after having caught up with your first, then rocket jumping as they 
                    hit the ground. The force obtained from a triple rocket jump is extreme and comparable to a double 
                    sticky jump, allowing you to soar through entire maps. There are two other versions of this jump 
                    called a Quad in which you fire your rocket after your third one which can lead into a Quint 
                    (five rockets) which will propel you very high from the floor upwards into the air from the quad. 
                    There are many jumps like this in <a href="https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_sync">jump_sync</a>.

                <h2>Surf (Jurf)</h2>
                <p>
                    Jurf, or jump surf, is an extension of Surfing, but it is done with the inclusion of rockets. 
                    Combining surf ramps and rockets allows for you to gain more speed and abuse ramp slides. 
                    Jurfing is necessary for certain jump maps such as <a href="https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_jurf_a2">jump_jurf</a>, 
                    and is very helpful in certain rollouts.

                <h2>Bounce</h2>
                <p>
                    A bounce is when a player touches a teleportation system on a floor or platform on the same frame that 
                    they shoot their rocket, launching them up and preventing them to be teleported back to the beginning 
                    of a level. This is similar to a Bouncehop (bunnyhop), in which you use the same technique but you only use spacebar 
                    and do not require the use of a Rocket Launcher. There are various maps that include this type of jumping 
                    method. Including <a href="https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_bounce">jump_bounce</a>, <a href="https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_bouncerific_v2">jump_bouncerific</a> 
                    and <a href="https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_bouncehop">jump_bouncehop</a>. Another variation of a bounce is a 
                    powerbounce. This is when you bouncehop using a Rocket Launcher on a teleport surface. to rocket jump 
                    higher then a normal bounce.

                    The <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Market_Gardener">Market Gardener</a>
                    will deal lethal critical hits <span class="red">(195 damage)</span> when the user is rocket
                    jumping.
                    Landing one of these can sometimes
                    lead to a very impressive and satisfactory kill. Enemy rockets, grenades, and stickies count as an
                    explosive jump if the player is not
                    killed by the explosion. Experienced players can sometimes use this to land critical hits against
                    enemies. Players can also bunnyhop on the
                    ground very precisely before hitting someone to gain a critical hit.

                <p>
                    Crouchtapping or Ctapping is when you tap crouch a split second before you jump. This makes you get
                    extra height when you do a rocket jump. Ctap rocket jumps are higher than normal rocket jumps because
                    crouching puts you closer to the ground(closer to the epicenter of the blast) send you further when
                    you rocket jump. Some maps will require this type of jump in order for it to be completed, such as
                    <a href="https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_legion_beta3">jump_legion</a>.

                <p>
                    Edgebugging is when you land on the very edge of a block and you slide off it slightly. If done correctly,
                    you maintain your falling state and horizontal velocity but take no fall damage. You can also edgebug on
                    surfaces with teleports on them. In addition to this, you can also edgeshot - which is when you shoot a
                    rocket when you are edgebugging. You can practice these on <a href="https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_edgebug_b2">jump_edgebug</a>.

                <p>
                    Angled wallbugs (wallbug) happen when your character model rubs up against an angled wall, which will cause your character to
                    temporarily stop, or even stop completely. You can usually recreate this glitch by holding the movement keys into the wall while
                    facing in a certain direction (holding W while facing the wall and pressing A+D in small intervals). These aren't too common but 
                    you can use them to surprise opponents and save yourself from dying to fall damage.
