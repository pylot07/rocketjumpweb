            <h2>Crouch-jumping</h2>
            <p>
                At any point during a jump, the player can crouch by pressing the pre-assigned button. This will cause the classes to bring their
                legs up in world view and move an additional Hammer unit up, as well as reduce their height by 27 Hammer units from the bottom of
                their hitbox. This allows them to reach higher surfaces or shrink their hitboxes to dodge enemy fire. By default, a player may only
                crouch and uncrouch twice while in the air to prevent several exploits.

                Crouch-jumping is also used to boost the effect of explosive knockback. By design, any jump involving an explosive will go farther
                with a crouch-jump than a regular jump.

            <h2>Air strafing</h2>
            <p>
                Air strafing allows players to curve in mid-air to change their trajectory. While airborne, it can be performed by simultaneously strafing
                and turning smoothly in the same direction. Attempting to move forward with the movement keys (such as holding W) during the maneuver will
                prevent the player from strafing, while attempting to move backward will also result in a decrease of speed.

            <h2>What is a "rocket jump?"</h2>
            <p>
                A rocket jump is any jump assisted by the explosive knockback of the Soldier's own rockets.
                A player can propel himself to great heights and distances, usually at the cost of some health.
                This technique is often used to reach unusual locations on the map, cover ground quickly, bypass barriers, and surprise foes.
                To assist with rocket jumps, the Soldier has a 40% damage resistance against any rocket he fires that hurts him while he is in the air. 
                This resistance will take effect even if an enemy was hit with the same rocket used to rocket jump, unlike the Gunboats.
                Critical hits do not deal extra self-damage or extra knockback to the Soldier, so they will not propel him further.
                Any rocket jumping Soldier will display burning, smoky boots until he lands, similar to the Demoman.

            <h2>Basic rocket jump</h2>
            <p>
                To execute a rocket jump, simultaneously jump and fire a rocket at the ground below. The angle of the shot and distance from the
                explosion will determine the velocity and height of the jump. Crouch-jumping before firing the rocket will launch the player
                significantly farther. The sooner the explosion is made after jumping, the farther and faster the Soldier will fly.

            <h2>Market gardening</h2>
            <p>
                The Market Gardener will deal lethal critical hits (195 damage) when the user is rocket jumping. Landing one of these can sometimes
                lead to a very impressive and satisfactory kill. Enemy rockets, grenades, and stickies count as an explosive jump if the player is not
                killed by the explosion. Experienced players can sometimes use this to land critical hits against enemies. Players can also bunnyhop on the
                ground very precisely before hitting someone to gain a critical hit.
